        <p>
            Sophie yelled goodbye and slipped away in the bustle. It did not seem
            right to take up more of Martha&#39;s time. Besides, she wanted to be alone to think.
        </p>
        <p>
            She ran home. There were fireworks now, going up from the field by
            the river where the Fair was, competing with the blue bangs from Howl&#39;s castle.
            Sophie felt more like an invalid than ever.
        </p>
        <p>
            She thought and thought, most of the following week, and all that
            happened was that she became confused and discontented. Things just did
            not seem to be the way she thought they were.
        </p>
        <p>
            She was amazed at Lettie and Martha. She had misunderstood them for years.
            But she could not believe Fanny was the kind of woman Martha said.
