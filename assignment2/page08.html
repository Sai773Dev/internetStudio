            Sophie thought he looked a nice lad. She longed to ask if he was the one Martha really liked, 
            but she did not get a chance. Martha sprang up in a hurry, still talking.
        </p>

            "I must get the girls to carry all these through to the shop," she said. 
            "Help me with the end of this one." She dragged out the nearest rack and 
            Sophie helped her hump it past the door into the roaring, busy shop.
        </p>
        <p>
            "You must do something about yourself, Sophie," Martha panted as they went. 
            "Lettie kept saying she didn&#39;t know what would happen to you when we 
            weren&#39;t around to give you some self-respect. She was right to be worried."
        </p>
        <p>
            In the shop, Mrs. Cesari seized the rack from them in both massive arms, 
            yelling instructions, and a line of people rushed away past Martha to fetch more.
