            Sophie was mostly alone in the shop. Fanny did seem to be out a lot, gadding or not, 
            and trade was slack after May Day. After three days Sophie plucked up courage to ask Fanny, 
            "Shouldn&#39;t I be earning a wage?"
        </p>
        <p>
            "Of course, my love, with all you do!" Fanny answered warmly, fixing on a rose-trimmed hat 
            in front of the shop mirror. "We&#39;ll see about it as soon as I&#39;ve done the accounts this evening."
            Then she went out and did not come back until Sophie had shut the shop and taken that day&#39;s hats 
            through to the house to trim.
        </p>
        <p>
            Sophie at first felt mean to have listened to Martha, but when Fanny did not mention a wage, 
            either that evening or any time later that week, Sophie began to think that Martha had been right.
        </p>
        <p>
            "Maybe I am being exploited," she told a hat she was trimming with red silk and a bunch of wax cherries, 
            "but someone has to do it."
